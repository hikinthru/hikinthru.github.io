title: Understanding Data Structures, Containers and Collections in Python
---
  
When I first began programming in Python I was sometimes confused by the way different authors and online sources referred to the various ways of holding, manipulating and processing sets of data. Three terms that I was not completely sure always referred to the same thing kept coming up: **data structures**, **containers**
and **collections**. I did a bit of research and finally expanded my notes out to this article. I do not go into any detail about the functionality of any of the specific container types in Python here (eg., `list`, `deque`, `tuple`, etc.).

## Terms

Most generally all of these terms in Python refer to ways of placing data into sets. Examples of types of data sets in Python include dictionaries (`my_dict = {"uno": "one", "dos": "two"}`), lists (`my_list = [3, 4, "five"]`) or tuples (`my_tuple = (6, 7, "zed")`). 

The term **data structure** is used informally to refer to both **container**s and **collection**s. Regarding the latter two however, in one way containers are a type of collection and in another collections are types of containers.

This is because there are two types of native containers in Python. One set are called **built-ins** and the other are **imported** if they are needed by the programmer. If you are not sure of the difference between these see [this](#built-in-vs-imported-object-types-and-functions) explanation below.

All containers are a type of collection in the technical sense that to determine if an object is a container, you ask Python, `isinstance(object, collections.Container)`. Which implies that by definition all containers are a Python sub-class of the class `collections`.

But you can also import the Python module `collections` to add additional container types to the *built-in containers* (e.g., `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, etc. that do not need to be imported). These additional types (e.g., `deque`, `Counter`, `defaultdict`) are often directly referred to as collections, even though they are really just containers with modified or additional functions.

## Attributes of *All* Containers

* Objects which have a `__contains__` method defined
* `isinstance(object, collections.Container)` returns `True`
* Can be searched or iterated with the `in` operator

## Built-in Container Types

According to [PyDocs 3.6.5 on Container datatypes](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/collections.html), Pythonâ€™s general purpose built-in containers are: `dict`, `list`, `set`, and `tuple`. Four additional built-in container types mentioned in [PyDocs 3.6.5 - Built-in Types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html) include `str`, `range`, `frozenset` and `bytearray`.

* *Basic sequence* type containers
  - Lists
  - Tuples
  - Ranges
* *Text sequence* type containers
  - Strings
* *Binary sequence* type containers
  - Bytearrays
* *Set* type containers
  - Sets
  - Frozensets (immutable)
* *Map* type containers
  - Dictionaries

## NOT Containers

Checked builtin object types which are **not** containers:
`isinstance(object, collections.Container` returns `False`:

* Int objects
* Float objects
* Long objects
* Boolean objects
* Module objects
* File objects
* Buffer objects
* The None object

## The `collections` Module

The Python module `collections` can be imported (like `math`) to add additional collection/container types available. The types in Python 3.5.6 are listed here.

| **Type** | **Description** |
|--|--|
| namedtuple( | factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named fields
| deque | list-like container with fast appends and pops on either end
| ChainMap | dict-like class for creating a single view of multiple mappings
| Counter | dict subclass for counting hashable objects
| OrderedDict* | dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added
| defaultdict | dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values
| UserDict | wrapper around dictionary objects for easier dict subclassing
| UserList | wrapper around list objects for easier list subclassing
| UserString | wrapper around string objects for easier string subclassing

## Built-in vs. Imported Object Types and Functions

When the Python interpreter begins running it loads a lot of functionality into the running computer's memory (RAM). But to keep from being a memory hog it must pick and choose (or rather its developers already have) what functionality will be loaded by default. We essentially get a 'base model' when we start Python. Everything in this base model is considered 'builtin.'

The options deemed important enough in common use to include on a base load of Python is not however all that the local version of Python contains for achieving a developer's goals. Many programs may need to use the functionality of Python's pi class (a class is a list of functionality for a command, such as `pi`), but not all programs. A developer who would like to use the Python class of `pi` in their program (without having to compute and program in its value themselves every time they need it) would import the Python module named `math`. The `math` module includes classes and functions to find cosines, tangents, arithmetic ceilings or floors, factorials, pi, etc.

If they are needed, Python modules such as `math` and `collections` can be added with the `import` command during the writing of the program, and every time the program runs these modules are added on to the code that the developer wrote.
