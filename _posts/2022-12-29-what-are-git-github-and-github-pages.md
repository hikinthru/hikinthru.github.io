title: Demystifying Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages
---

The 'gitverse' is like a great library, and like a great library it includes not only the books we want to read, but the process for organizing them, and the shelves to keep them stored on. Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages make up just three parts of the gitverse. I use all three of them today but when I first began with git about ten years ago, I did not completely understand this new and strange place. These three components of GitHub are separate but closely related because they work together, but they have very different functions. They all grew out of 'git', a solution to a growing problem when it was first created.

Linus Torvalds, the developer of Linux, wrote the program git in 2005 to manage the development and evolution of the Linux kernel, which was being collaborated on by other developers (and today by *many* others). The previous solution for managing this collaboration, [BitKeeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper), was no longer workable, so Torvalds began a new project to replace it and called it 'git.'

The git paradigm is made of a server (i.e., an application running on a computer that serves information that other applications can access) which holds the code or documentation for some application, and everyone that needs to, can access it, edit it, and improve it, without creating conflicts. A local version (called a *client*) also runs on the computers of the people that want to contribute to the project. The git client negotiates with the git server, to keep everything in order. Git also provides version control, which means that a writer or developer can go back to earlier versions if and when needed. 

Git allows multiple developers to work on a project from anywhere, and keep their changes organized and synced. Git is a *distributed version control system*, or DVCS, and that is all that 'git' itself is. The git application is open source and free for download from a variety of places on the Web, just Google "git download" with your client platform, or server platform if you want to run a version for yourself or your company.

#### GitHub ####
*GitHub* is an Internet Website at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) that provides limited free storage space that holds code and documentation for individuals and organizations. Each project has its own space and is called a *repository*. GitHub is a mega-repository for code and files that can be accessed by many people in collaboration. For example, the code for the application by Microsoft that is  called 'VS Code' (a programming editor that this and my Website were written in) lives on GitHub. The whole idea of git was for developers to be able to work in teams, but not necessarily in the same physical place. This allows them to work collaboratively but separately, on repositories of code for applications and development projects (way before the Covid shutdown). 

GitHub uses the functionality of git's servers and clients to keep changes by many contributors organized effectively.

#### GitHub Pages ####
*GitHub Pages* is a free additional option for anyone with a GitHub account to host one publicly accessible Website per account. Your Website address is automatically [https://your-user-name.github.io/](https://your-user-name.github.io) but GitHub Pages will also accommodate custom domains for free (you have to buy the domain).
