title: What Are Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages?
---

oiik,kkkkkkI now use all three extensively, but when I first began with git about a year ago, I did not understand the 'gitverse'. These three things, Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages are very related but completely different things. They all grew out of 'git'. 

Linus Torvalds, the developer of Linux, wrote the program git in 2005 to manage the development and evolution of the Linux kernel, which was and is being contributed to by many, many developers. Their previous solution for managing this collaboration [BitKeeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper), was no longer workable so Torvalds began a new project to coordinate their work and called it 'git.' The full exploitation of git assumes that a server (any application running on a computer that serves information that other applications can access, which may be the computer running the accessing program, or may be in Australia) exists somewhere that holds the code for some application, and everyone that needs to can access it, edit it and improve it, without creating clashes of changes.

When installed on a computer, 'git' is a software program that provides two main functions: it allows a developer to make changes and updates to their software, and if needed, go back to a previous point in time; and it allows multiple developers to work on a project remotely and in different places, and keep their changes organized and synced. `git is a *distributed version control system*, and that is all that 'git' is. 

#### GitHub ####
*GitHub* is an Internet Web site that provides free storage space and access to the **code** for programs, called a *repository*. GitHub is a repository for code that can be accessed by many people45555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555178888888888888888888888888888888888888888888 in collaboration. For example, the code for the application by Microsoft that is  called 'VS Code' (a programming editor) lives on GitHub. `git` was designed for developers working in teams but not necessarily in the same place, to work together on repositories of code for applications and development projects. GitHub uses the functionality of `git` to keep changes by many contributors organized effectively.

#### GitHub Pages ####
*GitHub Pages* is a free additional option for anyone with a GitHub account to host one publicly accessible Website per account. Your Website address is automatically [https://your-user-name.github.io/](https://your-user-name.github.io) but GitHub Pages will also accommodate custom domains for free (you have to buy the domain).
