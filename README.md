## About me

Online my username and alias is 'hikinthru' and is how I can be located on Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, FreeCodeCamp, StackExchange and other social and development sites to which I contribute.

I have spent more than twenty years in Information Technology: troubleshooting, repairing and supporting PC, Mac and server hardware and operating systems, productivity software and enterprise and network applications; database administration; and teaching and developing technical certification courses.

My hobbies today include Web Development, Python programming, and studying Data Science and Machine Learning

## The Technical Details About My Site

This site and its content were written and designed by myself. It is a simple blog using only a few technologies. Obviously HTML, but also some plain CSS, a little [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/">. The last four are further explained below.
  
I use a custom domain of 'hikinthru.com' which costs $12-$15 a year (depending on running sales when I renew). It is hosted (the code lives) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free, my GitHub Pages address is[https://hikinthru.github.io/](https://hikinthru.github.io/) but you will be redirected to my domain, GitHub Pages provides this forwarding service for free. The only limitation to the arrangement is that I cannot use https (secure, or encrypted http) for my domain while it is being hosted at GitHub. This is acceptable because I do not do any commerce and do not collect data from visitors over http. If you fill out the form on my Contact page your information is submitted over https by an organization named [SimpleForm](https://getsimpleform.com/).
  
My site also employs [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/") to keep my pages up to date. Jekyll is a "simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites." A *static site* is a Website delivered to the viewer exactly as it is stored. This is in contrast to dynamic Web pages which are generated with a Web application (written for example in PHP, JavaScript, Java or Python) with typically some form of database and/or AI, to react to a user's actions. Like mine, most personal, informational and even small business Websites are static; Websites that *do something* for you, e.g., commerce sites, financial sites, Wikies, etc., require databases and programming.

Jekyll, by design, allows me to make a change to the left column content, add or remove a link for example, in a single file, and it is applied to all pages on which I wish to display that column. I could do the same with a header or footer if I liked. It also allows me to simply write content (the blog articles) and put them in a folder called _posts, with a properly formatted file name, and Jekyll takes care of adding it to my article list on the main page. It is enormously helpful for someone who just wants to write an occasional article and not re-learn Jekyll and how to get a post up every few months.

My site uses Git for version control. Git is a separate thing from GitHub which is an online repository where my code lives, and GitHub Pages which provides online hosting services for my code. Git is a small program that you install on your development computer and provides *version control* for your project. Using Git means that if I make a change to a page and for example delete a paragraph without realizing it, I can go back the next day to a previous, saved version (the version saving happens automatically whenever I make something called a *commit*). This is obviously far more critical (and really designed for) developers working on large projects, especially if multiple developers are involved. Git was created by Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux) to provide source control management for open source projects, originally the Linux kernel project.

Git also provides the mechanism that synchronizes the code and content that I write on my computer, and the GitHub repository (free for you to view at [https://github.com/hikinthru](https://github.com/hikinthru)) where my code is saved, and in the case of this site, hosted.

If you would like information on any of the technologies I have used here feel free to [contact](contact.html") me.
