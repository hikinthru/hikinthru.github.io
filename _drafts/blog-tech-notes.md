<p> about my blog, this page is currently unique on my site. This blog (<a href='www.hikinthru.com'>www.hikinthru.com</a>) is hosted completely on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> for free, with my custom domain of hikinthru.com, and uses <a href='https://jekyllrb.com/'>Jekyll</a> to generate and maintain this list page and the articles once I upload them. I use <a href='https://code.visualstudio.com/'>Visual Studio Code</a> (also free) as my interface for GitHub. The rest of the pages on my site, <a href='www.sherriefuqua.com'>www.sherriefuqua.com</a>, are currently hosted by One.com (for much more than free) in a more typical hosting arrangement.</p>
