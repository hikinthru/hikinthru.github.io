<h2>About Me</h2>

<img src="assets/images/current_profile.jpg" class="photo" alt="My Profile Photo"><p>My name is Sherrie Fuqua. Online my username is 'hikinthru' and is how I can be located on Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, FreeCodeCamp, StackExchange and most social and development sites to which I contribute or subscribe.</p>

<p>I have spent more than twenty years in Information Technology which includes: troubleshooting, repairing and supporting PC, Mac and server hardware and operating systems, productivity software, and enterprise and network applications; database administration; and teaching and developing technical certification courses.</p>

<p>My interests today include Web Development, Python programming, and studying Data Science, most recently through <a href="https://www.edx.org/micromasters/data-science" target="_blank">edX and UC San Diego's Micromasters of Data Science</a> series.</p>

<p>I currently live in a small town in East Texas and work in Quality Assurance for Pilgrim's Pride and JBS-US.</p>

<h3>About My Site</h3>

<p>This site includes occasional articles that I write on technical topics or questions that I find interesting and have researched and learned answers to. I post them for a couple of reasons, 1) the site is almost free, it costs about $12US a year, and 2) I don't think I'm that unique in the things I wonder about. </p>

<h4 id='overview'>An Overview</h4>
<p>This site and its content were written and designed by myself. It is a simple blog using only a few technologies. Obviously HTML, but also some plain CSS, a little <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/'>Bootstrap</a> (advanced CSS for lazy people), <a href='https://git-scm.com/'>Git</a>, <a href='https://github.com/'>GitHub</a>, <a href='https://pages.github.com/'>GitHub Pages</a>, and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. The last four are further explained below. My photos and images as headers or in articles are all either mine, from <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>, or were found on the Internet and listed for royalty free public use (often from Wikipedia).</p>

<h4 id='hosting'>Hosting</h4>
<p>I have a custom domain of 'hikinthru.com' which costs $12-$15 a year (depending on running sales when I renew it). My code is stored at <a href='https://github.com/'>GitHub</a>, an online code repository (a place to keep code that others can see and even use), and my site is hosted (the code is served for you to view it as a Web site in your browser) by <a href='https://pages.github.com/'>GitHub Pages</a> (a slightly separate service from the repository) for free. My GitHub Pages address is <a href='https://hikinthru.github.io/'>https://hikinthru.github.io/</a> but you will be redirected to my custom domain, <a href='http://hikinthru.com'>http://hikinthru.com</a>. GitHub Pages provides this redirection service also for free.</p>

<h4 id='HTTPS'>HTTPS</h4>
<p>The only limitation to this arrangement is that I cannot use https (secure, or encrypted http) for my domain while it is being hosted at GitHub. This is acceptable because I do not do any commerce and do not collect data from visitors over http. If you fill out the form on my <a href='http://hikinthru.com/contact.html'>Contact</a> page your information is safely submitted over https by an organization named <a href='https://getsimpleform.com/'>SimpleForm</a>.</p>
  
<h4 id='mechanics'>Site Mechanics (Jekyll)</h4>
<p>My site also employs <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to keep my pages up to date. Online you will find Jekyll described as a "simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites." A <em>static site</em> is a Website delivered to the viewer exactly as it is stored. This is in contrast to dynamic Web pages which are generated, either on the Web server or locally, with a Web application, written for example in PHP, JavaScript, Java or Python, using typically some form of database and/or AI, to react to a user's actions. Like mine, most personal, informational and even small business Websites are static; Websites that <em>do something</em> for you, e.g., commerce and retail sites, financial sites, social sites, etc., require databases and some level of programming.</p>

<p>Jekyll, by design, allows me to make a change to the left column content, for example add or remove a link for a page, in a single file, and it is applied to all pages on which I display that column. I could do the same with a header or footer if I wished. It also allows me to  write content (the blog articles) and plop them into one folder, with a properly formatted file name, and Jekyll takes care of adding it to my article list on the main page. It is enormously useful for someone who just wants to write an occasional article and not re-learn Jekyll and how to get a post up every few months.</p>

<h4 id='git'>Git</h4>
<p>My Web and programming projects use Git for version control. Git is a separate thing from GitHub which is an online repository where my code lives, and GitHub Pages which provides online hosting services for my code. Git is a small program that you install on your development computer and it provides <em>version control</em> for your project. Using Git means that if I make a change to a page and for example delete a paragraph without realizing it, I can go back the next day to a previous, saved version (the version saving happens automatically whenever I make something called a <em>commit</em>). This is obviously far more critical (and really designed for) developers working on large projects, especially if multiple developers are involved. Git was created by Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux) to provide source control management for open source projects, originally the Linux kernel project.</p>

<p>Git also generously provides the mechanism that synchronizes the code and content that I write on my computer, and my GitHub repository online (available for you to view at <a href='https://github.com/hikinthru'>https://github.com/hikinthru</a>) where my code is saved, and in the case of this site, hosted. I do not do anything but push a series of two buttons in my code editor (one to 'commit' and one to 'push'), to 'publish' my changes or new articles. I do my programming and writing in an open-source text editor by Microsoft called <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> (it is a branch of <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> which is essentially a free clone of <a href='https://www.sublimetext.com/'>Sublime Text</a>) which intigrates synchronizing between my laptop and GitHub.</p>

<h4 id='further'>Further Information</h4>
